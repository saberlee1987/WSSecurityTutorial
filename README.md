This repository holds the code for a tutorial that is posted here: https://www.concentricsky.com/articles/detail/implementing-ws-security-cxf-wsdl-first-web-service.

It needs to be compiled under JDK 8, but otherwise should still work.

The branch `start` holds the starting point for the tutorial, and the branch `complete` holds the end-state code.
